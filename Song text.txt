Believe in memories to resurrect me
Besieged by falling dreams, hold them tightly
Adorn my wings to thee and use them nightly

I'm neither angel nor a demon spawn
Though some will call me God
Gravity is just a law I've wrought

Hear temptation take the sky for all to see
Sheer elation to write in history

I'm neither angel nor a demon spawn
Though some will call me God
Gravity is just a feeble plot
[Bridge]
When I said I'd never kneel again, what I really meant
Was fucking pull the pin 'cause time is spent, no!

I'm neither angel nor a demon spawn
Though some will call me God, fuck that!
Unite with ravens on their shadow flights as my nocturnal right
Gravity is just a mortal's vice and plot!

I can see again!
And when I said I'd never feel or see
Love and sight are last resorts for me
